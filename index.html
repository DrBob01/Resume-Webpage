    <h2>Career Highlights</h2>

        <h4>Bio-Sell Consulting Jan 2017 - Present · 7 years 8 months</h4>
          <p>At Bio-Sell Consulting we focus on "face-to-face" sales processes, and in particular, where complex products are being sold. The sales process for complex products often includes two or more stakeholders, each interested in a different aspect of the product. For example a technical stakeholder is interested in "how and the why" a product is beneficial, whereas the financial stakeholder is interested in the return on investment.</p> 

          <p>At Bio-Sell Consulting, we work directly with your sales team, to educate and facilitate their learning and how to put sales knowledge into practice. We offer "in-house" training programs which can be extended to included "in-field" training to insure learning implementation and assessment.</p>
